## Important Differences From Live Site
* currently, the dark mode does not work locally because the live site has a different file structure
  * Yet to be resolved on development environment cleanly...
* The name of the zip MUST be "te-custom-mods" in order for the dark mode CSS to work

## Releases
Releases represent a set of newly created features, or any bug fix that was "hot-fixed" on the live site through WordPress directly. Any releases marked "STABLE" mean that the attached zip files have been uploaded successfully to WordPress without issue. The latest release is intended to reflect what is on the live site.
